# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Lastly, evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results
### Naive Random Oversampling
The balanced accuracy score was 63.3%
The high risk precision score was 1%
The high risk recall score was 65%
